As a rule, it is assumed that the legal entity is represented by a legal\r\n                    representative or a person having a power of attorney for representation. In respect of powers of\r\n                    attorney and documents that were drawn up in foreign countries; it must be taken into account that\r\n                    they must be legalized or apostilled. When dealing with a document authorizing the rights of\r\n                    representation, it is necessary to clarify the fact whether the entity who issued the document had\r\n                    the authority to do so. The representative of the legal entity is expected to have knowledge of\r\n                    economic or professional activities, the purpose of the transaction, business partners, sources and\r\n                    origin of the funds used, the range of owners and other knowledge.\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                    Beneficial owner means a natural person who, taking advantage of their influence, makes a\r\n                    transaction, act, action, operation or step or otherwise exercises control over a transaction, act,\r\n                    action, operation or step or over another person and in whose interests or favour or on whose\r\n                    account a transaction or act, action, operation or step is made. In the case of companies, a\r\n                    beneficial owner is the natural person who ultimately owns or controls a legal person through direct\r\n                    or indirect ownership of a sufficient percentage of the shares or voting rights or ownership\r\n                    interest in that person, including through bearer shareholdings, or through control via other means.\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            Direct ownership is a manner of exercising control whereby a natural person holds a\r\n                            shareholding of 25 per cent plus one share or an ownership interest of more than 25 per cent\r\n                            in a company. Indirect ownership is a manner of exercising control whereby a company which\r\n                            is under the control of a natural person holds or multiple companies which are under the\r\n                            control of the same natural person hold a shareholding of 25 per cent plus one share or an\r\n                            ownership interest of more than 25 per cent in a company.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            Where, after all possible means of identification have been exhausted, the person specified\r\n                            in this section of this part cannot be identified and there is no doubt that such person\r\n                            exists or where there are doubts as to whether the identified person is a beneficial owner,\r\n                            the natural person who holds the position of a senior managing official is deemed as a\r\n                            beneficial owner.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            The obliged entity may consider the actual beneficial owner also the person who exercises\r\n                            control over the enterprise in another way, other than ownership interest of more than 25\r\n                            per cent in the said enterprise. This procedure develops when an obliged entity has a\r\n                            suspicion that an overwhelming control over the enterprise is being exercised by a third\r\n                            party, whose communication with the enterprise cannot be legally proven or the proof is\r\n                            difficult.
