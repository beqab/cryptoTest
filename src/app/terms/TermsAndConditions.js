                        In order to fund your Account and begin trading, you will need to: 1) procure Digital Assets or
                        2) fund the account with fiat currency. IEX allows Users to exchange Digital Assets directly for
                        fiat currency, or vice versa. You may purchase Digital Assets via third parties, such as U.S.
                        Dollar Tether (<b>“USDT”</b>). Once purchased, you can send such purchased digital assets to the
                        applicable address provided by IEX and wait for the balance to appear in your Account.
                        Alternatively, if you already own Digital Assets, you may send Digital Assets you already own to
                        the applicable address provided by IEX and wait for the balance to appear in your Account. It is
                        your responsibility to ensure you send the Digital Assets to the correct address provided for
                        that particular Digital Asset, else your funds may never be recovered.

                        Trading Digital Assets can be extremely risky. Each Digital Asset has unique features that make
                        it more or less likely to fluctuate in value. In addition, factors beyond IEX’s control may
                        affect market liquidity for a particular Digital Asset, such as regulatory activity, market
                        manipulation, or unexplainable price volatility. Blockchain networks may go offline as a result
                        of bugs, Forks (defined below), or a number of other unforeseeable reasons. As a general matter,
                        we advise Users with limited trading experience and low risk tolerance not to engage in active
                        trading. Speculating on the value of Digital Assets is high risk and Users should never trade
                        more than they can afford to lose.

                        Understanding Digital Assets requires advanced technical knowledge. Digital Assets are often
                        described in exceedingly technical language that requires a comprehensive understanding of
                        applied cryptography and computer science in order to appreciate inherent risks. Listing of a
                        Digital Asset on IEX does not indicate approval or disapproval of the underlying technology
                        regarding any Digital Asset and should not be used as a substitute for your own understanding of
                        the risks specific to each Digital Asset. We give you no warranty as to the suitability of the
                        Digital Asset traded under this Agreement and assume no fiduciary duty in our relations with
                        you.

                        Certain Digital Assets are built on protocols that support staking. If you hold these Digital
                        Assets in your Account, IEX may stake these Digital Assets on your behalf. Staking subjects your
                        Digital Assets to additional risks. IEX is not responsible for losses you may incur related to
                        staking.

                        The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in
