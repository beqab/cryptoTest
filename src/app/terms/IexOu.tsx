                    For the purpose of identification, assessment and analysis of risks of money laundering and
                    terrorist financing related to their activities, obliged entities prepare a risk assessment, taking
                    account of at least the following risk categories:
                    <br /> &nbsp;1) &nbsp;risks relating to customers;
                    <br /> &nbsp;2) &nbsp;risks relating to countries, geographic areas or jurisdictions;
                    <br /> &nbsp;3) &nbsp;risks relating to products, services or transactions;
                    <br /> &nbsp;4) &nbsp;risk relating to communication, mediation or products, services, transactions
                    or delivery channels between the obliged entity and customers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The steps taken to identify, assess and analyse risks must be proportionate to the nature, size and
                    level of complexity of the economic and professional activities of the obliged entity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a result of the risk assessment, the obliged entity establishes:
                    <br /> 1) &nbsp;fields of a lower and higher risk of money laundering and terrorist financing;
                    <br /> &nbsp;2) &nbsp;the risk appetite, including the volume and scope of products and services
                    provided in the course of business activities;
                    <br /> &nbsp;3) &nbsp;the risk management model, including simplified and enhanced due diligence
                    measures, in order to mitigate identified risks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Risk appetite means the total of the exposure level and types of the obliged entity, which the
                    obliged entity is prepared to assume for the purpose of its economic activities and attainment of
                    its strategic goals, and which is established by the senior management of the obliged entity in
                    writing. When applying the above, one should also take into account the risk that the obliged entity
                    is ready to accept or that it wishes to avoid in connection with its commercial activities and with
                    qualitative and quantitative mechanisms such as planned income, capital or other methods used by
                    other liquid funds, or other circumstances, such as reputational risks and money laundering and
                    terrorist financing, or legal and other risks associated with unethical activities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When applying Risk appetite to the risk, the obliged entity must at least determine those of the
                    customer&rsquo;s characteristics which should be to avoided in business relations and, in the
                    presence of which, it would be necessary to apply the increased customer due diligence measures,
                    including those when the obliged entity has to assess the risks associated with this customer and
                    appoint the appropriate methods to reduce these risks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The risk assessment and the establishment of the risk appetite must be documented, the documents are
                    to be updated where necessary and based on the published results of the national risk assessment. At
                    the request of the competent supervisory authority, the obliged entity submits the documents to the
                    supervisory authority.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When applying the AML/CFT it is expected that an obliged entity that is the parent undertaking of a
                    group applies group-wide rules of procedure and the internal control rules for controlling adherence
                    thereto regardless of whether all the undertakings of the group are located in one country or in
                    different countries. This obligation includes, inter alia, the establishment of a group-wide
                    procedure for exchanging information on of the AML/CFT and the establishment of similar rules for
                    protection of personal data. The obliged entity ensures that group-wide rules of procedure and the
                    internal control rules for controlling adherence thereto take to the appropriate extent account of
                    the law of another Member State of the European Union which implements Directive (EU) 2015/849 of
                    the European Parliament and of the Council, where the obliged entity has a representation, branch or
                    majority-owned subsidiary in that Member State.
                </li>
                <li>

                    country where the minimum requirements for AML/CFT are not equivalent to those of Directive (EU)
                    2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the representation, branch and
                    majority-owned subsidiary follow the rules of procedure and internal control rules complying with
                    the requirements of this Act, including the requirements for protection of personal data, to the
                    extent permitted by the law of the third country.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where the obliged entity identifies a situation where the law of the third country does not allow
                    for implementing rules of procedure or internal control rules complying with the requirements of the
                    AML/CFT in its representation, branch or majority-owned subsidiary, the obliged entity informs the
                    competent supervisory authority thereof. The competent supervisory authority notifies the Member
                    States and, where relevant, the European supervisory authorities where it has become evident in
                    accordance with the first sentence of this subsection that the law of the third country does not
                    allow for applying rules of procedure or internal control rules complying with the requirements of
                    Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council. In the case specified in this
                    section, the obliged entity ensures the application of additional measures in the representation,
                    branch or majority-owned subsidiary so that the risks relating to money laundering or terrorist
                    financing are effectively managed in another manner, informing the competent supervisory authority
                    of the measures taken. In such an event the competent supervisory authority has the right to issue a
                    precept demanding, inter alia, that the obliged entity or its representation, branch or
                    majority-owned subsidiary:

                <br /> &nbsp;5) &nbsp;apply other measures provided for in regulatory technical standards adopted by the
                European Commission on the basis of Article 45(7) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament
                and of the Council.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    When establishing a legal entity, the obliged entity must register the actual beneficial owner of
                    the legal entity. As a rule, it is assumed that the legal entity is represented by a legal
                    representative or a person having a power of attorney for representation. In respect of powers of
                    attorney and documents that were drawn up in foreign countries; it must be taken into account that
                    they must be legalized or apostilled. When dealing with a document authorizing the rights of
                    representation, it is necessary to clarify the fact whether the entity who issued the document had
                    the authority to do so. The representative of the legal entity is expected to have knowledge of
                    economic or professional activities, the purpose of the transaction, business partners, sources and
                    origin of the funds used, the range of owners and other knowledge.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Beneficial owner means a natural person who, taking advantage of their influence, makes a
                    transaction, act, action, operation or step or otherwise exercises control over a transaction, act,
                    action, operation or step or over another person and in whose interests or favour or on whose
                    account a transaction or act, action, operation or step is made. In the case of companies, a
                    beneficial owner is the natural person who ultimately owns or controls a legal person through direct
                    or indirect ownership of a sufficient percentage of the shares or voting rights or ownership
                    interest in that person, including through bearer shareholdings, or through control via other means.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Direct ownership is a manner of exercising control whereby a natural person holds a
                            shareholding of 25 per cent plus one share or an ownership interest of more than 25 per cent
                            in a company. Indirect ownership is a manner of exercising control whereby a company which
                            is under the control of a natural person holds or multiple companies which are under the
                            control of the same natural person hold a shareholding of 25 per cent plus one share or an
                            ownership interest of more than 25 per cent in a company.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Where, after all possible means of identification have been exhausted, the person specified
                            in this section of this part cannot be identified and there is no doubt that such person
                            exists or where there are doubts as to whether the identified person is a beneficial owner,
                            the natural person who holds the position of a senior managing official is deemed as a
                            beneficial owner.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The obliged entity may consider the actual beneficial owner also the person who exercises
                            control over the enterprise in another way, other than ownership interest of more than 25
                            per cent in the said enterprise. This procedure develops when an obliged entity has a
                            suspicion that an overwhelming control over the enterprise is being exercised by a third
                            party, whose communication with the enterprise cannot be legally proven or the proof is
                            difficult. In this case, information should be required about their owners, partners and
                            other persons who control the activities of the legal entity or have any other significant
                            influence.

                            In the case of a trust, civil law partnership, community or legal arrangement, the
                            beneficial owner is the natural person who ultimately controls the association via direct or
                            indirect ownership or otherwise and is such associations&rsquo;: settlor or person who has
                            handed over property to the asset pool; &nbsp;trustee or manager or possessor of the

                            beneficiaries have yet to be determined, the class of persons in whose main interest such
                            association is set up or operates.

                        <li>
                            In the case of a person or an association of persons not specified in clauses 2 and 6 of
                            this section, a member or members of the management board may be designated as a beneficial
                            owner.

                        <li>
                            The obliged entity registers and keeps records of all actions taken in order to identify the
                            beneficial owner.

                            If this is the case with a commercial entity whose securities are traded on the regulated
                            securities market, then there is no need to establish the actual beneficial owner of this
                            commercial entity.
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The obliged entity analyzes the documents submitted by the representative of the legal
                            entity and, if necessary, requests additional documents and data in order to establish the
                            legal beneficial owner (s) of the legal entity.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the obliged entity has a suspicion about the accuracy or completeness of the relevant
                            information, then a thorough check of the information provided on open accessible sources of
                            information must be performed and, if necessary, the customer should be requested to provide
                            additional information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If it is not clear from the documents on the basis of which the legal entity is being
                            established or from other documents provided, who is the actual beneficial owner, then the
                            relevant data has to be recorded from the words of the representative of the legal entity or
                            on the basis of a written document signed by him personally. It is necessary to apply
                            reasonable methods (to make inquiries in the appropriate registers), to require the
                            provision of an annual report of a legal entity or the provision of other relevant
                            documents, in order to verify the information received on the basis of a document which was
                            drawn up from the words or handwritten.

                        <li>
                            When determining the actual beneficial owner, it is necessary to pay primarily attention to
                            commercial entities that are established in a zone with low taxation, the legal capacity of
                            which is not always straightforward.

                            controlled legal entity, then the obliged entity must assess the risks of the person or the
                            customer and, in appropriate order, collect information in relation to another legal entity
                            related to this legal entity, in order to establish the actual beneficial owner.

                            sense of identifying the person who controls the activity of the audited persoon;

                            natural person was inclined to create a business relationship or to conduct a transaction.
                            In this case, it is necessary to consider that entity which controls a natural person is the
